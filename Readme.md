## Assignment Description

The assignment involves building a well-responsive table with 20 records. Using just HTML and CSSS, and publishing to GitHub.

## Solution Overview
1. **HTML Structure**:
To create the table, I started with the HTML structure. I use the HTML table element to create the table, "th" element for the table header. Each row are represented by tr element, and columns within each row  represented by td (table data) elements.
2. **CSS Styling**
For styling, I created a separate CSS file (styles.css) and link it in the HTML document. In the CSS file, I defined styles for various elements to make the table responsive and visually appealing.
3. **Adding Data**:
To fulfill the assignment's requirement of having 20 records, I added rows to the table by duplicating the tr element. Each <tr> represents one record, and each <td> represents a field within that record.
4. **Push to GitHub**:
After I had created the HTML file (index.html) and the CSS file (styles.css), with the use of the Github extension on Visual codev bulder, I pushed my folder to a new public repository on my Github account.
