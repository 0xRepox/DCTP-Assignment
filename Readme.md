## Assignment Description

The assignment involves building a well-responsive table with 20 records. Using just HTML and CSSS, and publishing to GitHub.

## Solution Overview
1. **HTML Structure:
To create the table, we'll start with the HTML structure. We'll use the HTML table element to create the table, "th" element for the table header. Each row will be represented by tr element, and columns within each row will be represented by td (table data) elements.
2. **CSS Styling
For styling, we'll create a separate CSS file (styles.css) and link it in the HTML document. In the CSS file, we can define styles for various elements to make the table responsive and visually appealing.
